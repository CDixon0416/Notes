#### What are Canarytokens
You'll be familiar with web bugs, the transparent images which track when someone opens an email. They work by embedding a unique URL in a page's image tag, and monitoring incoming GET requests.

Imagine doing that, but for file reads, database queries, process executions or patterns in log files. Canarytokens does all this and more, letting you implant traps in your production systems rather than setting up separate honeypots.

#### Why should you use them
Network breaches happen. From mega-corps, to governments. From unsuspecting grandmas to well-known security pros. This is (kinda) excusable. What isn't excusable, is only finding out about it, months or years later.

Canarytokens are a free, quick, painless way to help defenders discover they've been breached (by having attackers announce themselves.)

<summary>Description</summary>

#### The Cyber Swiss Army Knife
CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

The tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built and incrementally improved by an analyst in their 10% innovation time over several years.
